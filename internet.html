                                I had a sanwich from Jersey Mike's for dinner just now. It was a roast beef and provalone sub,
                                but I didn't get enough sauce on it so it was a bit dry. I exchanged money for it.</p></li>

                            <li>In actuality, we are uncertain what the beef really is. Is it meat from a cow? Does it refer to
